## What is Chorus?
Chorus is an easy-to-use and lightweight [YAML](http://yaml.org/) editor, created for anyone who works on [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org)-based Minecraft servers.  
Thanks to its features, Chorus is perfect to edit configurations quickly and easily. 

## Why Chorus?
**Chorus has a lot of features that will help you edit your configuration with extreme ease:**

## Writing your own add-on
Since 1.3, Chorus supports custom **JavaScript add-ons**.   
Check out the official [wiki](https://github.com/iAmGio/chorus/wiki) for API documentation.  
Although an official marketplace is not ready yet, you can publish your add-ons by submitting your files to the [add-ons repository](https://github.com/iAmGio/chorus-addons) following the instructions given in its README.  
In order to load an add-on, place the .js file inside the `chorus/addons` folder.

## Creating your own theme
Chorus supports custom themes. If you want to create your own, create a folder into chorus/themes named as your theme's name.   
In this folder, you have to create the following files:
* **{name}.css**, to style the main view;    
* **{name}-highlight.css** to style keywords;    
* **{name}-settings.css** to style setting view;    

_Note: {name} must be the same as your folder's name._

To see the structure of a style file, take a look at this theme:   
* [Main](https://github.com/iAmGio/chorus/blob/master/src/assets/styles/light.css)       
* [Highlight](https://github.com/iAmGio/chorus/blob/master/src/assets/styles/light-highlight.css)    
* [Settings](https://github.com/iAmGio/chorus/blob/master/src/assets/styles/light-settings.css)

If you want to make it public, you can add it to the official [themes repository](https://github.com/iAmGio/chorus-themes) following [these](https://github.com/iAmGio/chorus-themes/blob/master/README.md) guidelines.
